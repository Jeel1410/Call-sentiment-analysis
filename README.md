Customer Sentiment Analysis With Data Masking

Customer Feedback Manually to Automatically Using natural language processing (NLP)
It can be used to automatically process and analyze customer feedback that has been provided in the form of natural language text. One way to use NLP to process customer feedback is to first perform text preprocessing, which involves cleaning and organizing the raw text data. This may include tasks such as tokenization (splitting the text into individual words), lemmatization (reducing words to their base form), and removing stop words (common words that do not provide meaningful information).

Once the text has been preprocessed, it can be fed into an NLP model, which will analyze the text and extract relevant information. This may include identifying the overall sentiment of the feedback (positive, negative), extracting key phrases or topics, and identifying any specific issues or concerns raised by the customer.

The output of the NLP model can then be used to automatically categorize and prioritize customer feedback, or to trigger alerts or other actions based on the content of the feedback. It can also be used to generate reports or insights that summarize the key trends or patterns in the customer feedback.
